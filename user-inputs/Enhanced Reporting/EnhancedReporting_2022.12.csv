For informational purposes SCE is providing the following text regarding water management in the Big Creek Hydroelectric Project. 

SCE holds 22 non-consumptive water rights that support the operation of the Big Creek Hydroelectric Project. In addition to complying with the terms of SCE’s water rights, SCE is contractually required to meet certain cumulative reservoir storage and release requirements pursuant to an agreement with the United States Bureau of Reclamation to support its operations at Friant. Depending on the time of year, SCE’s Water Plan will call for either the net storage or net release of the total, aggregate Project water – to support electricity generation and the water needs of USBR and those supplied by USBR. To provide the Water Board with the clearest picture of water availability and avoid duplicate reporting, SCE is reporting its future demand and projected releases as aggregate numbers for the entire Project utilizing SCE’s Water Plan for the Project. This plan is also used to coordinate with USBR on storage and release requirements and needs. This plan generates monthly forecasts of total reservoir storage and releases to the San Joaquin River by forecasting anticipated inflows to the Project, using reservoir storage on the first of each month, and estimating the planned Project outflows to determine the aggregate change in monthly storage and the volume of water release to the San Joaquin River from the Project. These aggregated values provide a more accurate representation of the total volume of water stored on the Project and water released to the San Joaquin River for other downstream water rights holders. Therefore, SCE is providing this aggregated projected demand water use for the entire Big Creek Project (based on the Water Plan described above). The Water Plan can be provided to Bay-Delta@waterboards.ca.gov site upon request.

In December 2022 reservoir storage in the Big Creek Hydroelectric Project (Project) is anticipated to decrease. Based on SCE’s Water Plan, which is developed and updated monthly by SCE’s water management team, forecasted inflows and outflows at the Big Creek Project will be approximately 20,000 acre-feet and 71,600 acre-feet, respectively. This will result in a forecasted aggregate decrease in reservoir storage of approximately 51,600 acre-feet in December.

Water from this diversion will not be retained in storage in December. Water from this diversion is stored in Redinger Lake. SCE's water plan for December predicts that storage in Redinger Lake will decrease in the month of December.

For informational purposes SCE is providing the following text regarding water management in the Big Creek Hydroelectric Project. 

SCE holds 22 non-consumptive water rights that support the operation of the Big Creek Hydroelectric Project. In addition to complying with the terms of SCE’s water rights, SCE is contractually required to meet certain cumulative reservoir storage and release requirements pursuant to an agreement with the United States Bureau of Reclamation to support its operations at Friant. Depending on the time of year, SCE’s Water Plan will call for either the net storage or net release of the total, aggregate Project water – to support electricity generation and the water needs of USBR and those supplied by USBR. To provide the Water Board with the clearest picture of water availability and avoid duplicate reporting, SCE is reporting its future demand and projected releases as aggregate numbers for the entire Project utilizing SCE’s Water Plan for the Project. This plan is also used to coordinate with USBR on storage and release requirements and needs. This plan generates monthly forecasts of total reservoir storage and releases to the San Joaquin River by forecasting anticipated inflows to the Project, using reservoir storage on the first of each month, and estimating the planned Project outflows to determine the aggregate change in monthly storage and the volume of water release to the San Joaquin River from the Project. These aggregated values provide a more accurate representation of the total volume of water stored on the Project and water released to the San Joaquin River for other downstream water rights holders. Therefore, SCE is providing this aggregated projected demand water use for the entire Big Creek Project (based on the Water Plan described above). The Water Plan can be provided to Bay-Delta@waterboards.ca.gov site upon request.

In December 2022 reservoir storage in the Big Creek Hydroelectric Project (Project) is anticipated to decrease. Based on SCE’s Water Plan, which is developed and updated monthly by SCE’s water management team, forecasted inflows and outflows at the Big Creek Project will be approximately 20,000 acre-feet and 71,600 acre-feet, respectively. This will result in a forecasted aggregate decrease in reservoir storage of approximately 51,600 acre-feet in December.
