The Diversion Agreement sets forth the terms under which water is available to the Joint Water Districts.  If water is unavailable under the Joint Water Districts’ water right, diversions continue pursuant to the terms of the Diversion Agreement, including diversions of previously stored water from the State Water Project or other sources.  
The Diversion Agreement divides the calendar year into the allotted “irrigation season” April 1 through October 31 and the non-allotted season of November 1 through March 31.  In 2022, In 2022 the Joint Water Districts’ irrigation season supply will be reduced by 50% pursuant to the Diversion Agreement.  The non-allotted water season beginning November 1 is not limited by volume, but rather by reasonable and beneficial use.

Estimated and/or measured water diversion amounts under those other water related rights for the instant reporting year will be reported in the annual Supplemental Statement of Water Diversion and Use for that year for the Statement Number(s) that has(have) been assigned to the point(s) of diversion that provide(s) water to the place of use of this license under those other rights and/or claims. 

To avoid duplicative reporting of diversion amounts for the place of use of this license under this license report and that(those) Statement Number report(s), the number “0.1” is reported for the amounts directly diverted and/or projected to be directly diverted as a placeholder in this report. 

The actual estimated and/or measured diversion amounts that were made under this license during the months authorized under this license, and during times when this license is not curtailed, will be the diversion amounts reported for those months in said Statement Number report(s) for the instant reporting year, and capped, if necessary, by the maximum monthly diversion amounts allowable under this license to the extent any of the monthly diversion amounts in said Statement Number report(s) exceed those maximum amounts.

This reporting methodology is adopted voluntarily to eliminate duplicative reporting consistent with the Delta Watermaster’s “Consensus Strategy for Avoiding Duplicative Reporting of Water Diversion and Use in the Delta,” dated February 1, 2021.  The use of this reporting methodology does not commit the owner to use this methodology in the future, nor does it waive or impair any of the owner’s rights to divert and use water pursuant to this license or pursuant to any other water related rights."
