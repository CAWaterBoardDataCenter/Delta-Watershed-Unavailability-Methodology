For informational purposes SCE is providing the following text regarding water management in the Big Creek Hydroelectric Project. 

SCE holds 22 non-consumptive water rights that support the operation of the Big Creek Hydroelectric Project. In addition to complying with the terms of SCE’s water rights, SCE is contractually required to meet certain cumulative reservoir storage and release requirements pursuant to an agreement with the United States Bureau of Reclamation to support its operations at Friant. Depending on the time of year, SCE’s Water Plan will call for either the net storage or net release of the total, aggregate Project water – to support electricity generation and the water needs of USBR and those supplied by USBR. To provide the Water Board with the clearest picture of water availability and avoid duplicate reporting, SCE is reporting its future demand and projected releases as aggregate numbers for the entire Project utilizing SCE’s Water Plan for the Project. This plan is also used to coordinate with USBR on storage and release requirements and needs. This plan generates monthly forecasts of total reservoir storage and releases to the San Joaquin River by forecasting anticipated inflows to the Project, using reservoir storage on the first of each month, and estimating the planned Project outflows to determine the aggregate change in monthly storage and the volume of water release to the San Joaquin River from the Project. These aggregated values provide a more accurate representation of the total volume of water stored on the Project and water released to the San Joaquin River for other downstream water rights holders. Therefore, SCE is providing this aggregated projected demand water use for the entire Big Creek Project (based on the Water Plan described above). The Water Plan can be provided to Bay-Delta@waterboards.ca.gov site upon request.

In January 2023 reservoir storage in the Big Creek Hydroelectric Project (Project) is anticipated to increase. Based on SCE’s Water Plan, which is developed and updated monthly by SCE’s water management team, forecasted inflows and outflows at the Big Creek Project will be approximately 26,100 acre-feet and 9,400 acre-feet, respectively. This will result in a forecasted aggregate increase in reservoir storage of approximately 16,700 acre-feet in January.

Since we cannot pump water in accordance with our permit, why are being made to report this when we are not able to use the water?  If there was water in the ridge cut, it would be nice to be able to pre-irrigate my fields because it would benefit my fields next year by banking water in the soil.

For informational purposes SCE is providing the following text regarding water management in the Big Creek Hydroelectric Project. 

SCE holds 22 non-consumptive water rights that support the operation of the Big Creek Hydroelectric Project. In addition to complying with the terms of SCE’s water rights, SCE is contractually required to meet certain cumulative reservoir storage and release requirements pursuant to an agreement with the United States Bureau of Reclamation to support its operations at Friant. Depending on the time of year, SCE’s Water Plan will call for either the net storage or net release of the total, aggregate Project water – to support electricity generation and the water needs of USBR and those supplied by USBR. To provide the Water Board with the clearest picture of water availability and avoid duplicate reporting, SCE is reporting its future demand and projected releases as aggregate numbers for the entire Project utilizing SCE’s Water Plan for the Project. This plan is also used to coordinate with USBR on storage and release requirements and needs. This plan generates monthly forecasts of total reservoir storage and releases to the San Joaquin River by forecasting anticipated inflows to the Project, using reservoir storage on the first of each month, and estimating the planned Project outflows to determine the aggregate change in monthly storage and the volume of water release to the San Joaquin River from the Project. These aggregated values provide a more accurate representation of the total volume of water stored on the Project and water released to the San Joaquin River for other downstream water rights holders. Therefore, SCE is providing this aggregated projected demand water use for the entire Big Creek Project (based on the Water Plan described above). The Water Plan can be provided to Bay-Delta@waterboards.ca.gov site upon request.

In January 2023 reservoir storage in the Big Creek Hydroelectric Project (Project) is anticipated to increase. Based on SCE’s Water Plan, which is developed and updated monthly by SCE’s water management team, forecasted inflows and outflows at the Big Creek Project will be approximately 26,100 acre-feet and 9,400 acre-feet, respectively. This will result in a forecasted aggregate increase in reservoir storage of approximately 16,700 acre-feet in January.

The December 15, 2022, Projected Demand Form shows 0.00 acre feet of demand for the Four Entities for January 2023. That is not accurate as a matter of fact, as the Four Entities continue to have consumptive demand for water during this period. However, the United States Bureau of Reclamation, responsible for meeting the requirements of the Second Amended Exchange Contract (which provides the Four Entities’ water supply in most years) has exercised its discretion to meet Four Entities’ January 2023 demands from sources available to it other than the San Joaquin River. Thus, for purposes of calculating the Four Entities’ demands from the San Joaquin River, a zero acre foot demand from that source may be appropriate, for so long as USBR continues to supply Four Entities’ demands from other sources. 
For informational purposes, we note the April 19, 2022, Water Unavailability Methodology anticipated Four Entities’ demands commencing from the San Joaquin River in April 2022, but did not provide for a reversion back to other sources later in the year. In 2022, USBR stopped meeting Four Entities’ demands from San Joaquin River diversions on July 21, 2022.

The Diversion Agreement sets forth the terms under which water is available to the Joint Water Districts.  If water is unavailable under the Joint Water Districts’ water right, diversions continue pursuant to the terms of the Diversion Agreement, including diversions of previously stored water from the State Water Project or other sources.  

The Diversion Agreement divides the calendar year into the allotted “irrigation season” April 1 through October 31 and the non-allotted season of November 1 through March 31.  In 2022, In 2022 the Joint Water Districts’ irrigation season supply will be reduced by 50% pursuant to the Diversion Agreement.  The non-allotted water season beginning November 1 is not limited by volume, but rather by reasonable and beneficial use.  The Joint Water Districts have utilized a projected demand of 0 acre feet for the month of January instead of the projected 25,039 acre feet the State Water Board has projected.
